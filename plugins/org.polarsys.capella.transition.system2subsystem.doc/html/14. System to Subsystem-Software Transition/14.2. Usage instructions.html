		<p>Transitions are possible from one or several logical, physical components or one Configuration Item. The Multiphase Transition is only available from one or more selected node physical components.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Open the source Capella project model</li>
			<li>Select one or several components (in the Project Explorer or in a 	diagram).</li>
			<li>From the contextual menu (right click), select 	&ldquo;System To SubSystem Transition&rdquo; and then, the kind of 	Transition to be performed.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 id="Configuration_of_the_Transition">Configuration of the Transition</h2>
		<p>A configuration dialog opens and allows, among others, to choose the target model.</p>

		<p>Once the target project selected, a dialog displaying the differences and the actions planned by the transition is displayed.</p>
		<p>In the window, elements are sorted out by types</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The column &quot;Type&quot; indicates whether the 	difference concerns the presence of an element &ldquo;Element&rdquo; 	or the modification of a reference on an element &quot;Reference&quot;.</li>
			<li>The column &quot;Scope&quot; 	indicates whether the difference was found on the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; 	or &ldquo;Target&rdquo; model</li>
			<li>The column &quot;Differences&quot; 	indicates the title of the difference.</li>
			<li>The column &quot;Action&quot; indicates the type 	of action planned by the transition:
				<ul>
					<li>&quot;Merge into target&quot;: application of 		the merge of the difference in the output model</li>
					<li>&quot;No predefined Action&quot;: the difference 		is not taken into account</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>*</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The column &quot;Detail&quot; 	gives the complete detail of the difference to investigative 	purposes very thin.</li>
		</ul>

		</p>
		<p>The effective application of the transition is performed by clicking on the button &quot;Apply Transition &quot;. The &quot;Save as CSV&quot; button allows to export the differences in a CSV file for a further analysis of the deviations.</p>
		<p>It is possible to choose the type of elements that should be displayed in the difference window. To do so, choose Window / Preferences and then Capella / Transition Log Preferences.</p>

		<h2 id="Transition_Log">Transition Log</h2>
		<p>Once the transition performed, the Information view contains the listing of the actions performed. By right clicking on an action, the source and target object can be accessed:</p>

		<h2 id="Validation_Rules">Validation Rules</h2>
		<p>The vertical transformation SA-LA-PA includes 4 validation rules that warn the user about inconsistent element allocations and deployments on target models. In general, these rules inspect the pre-allocation links generated by the multiphase transformation and crosscheck existing allocations and deployments against these pre-allocation links. A pre-allocation link is a kind of trace and thus filtered from the Capella Explorer by default. Each rule verifies a specific kind of allocation/deployment:</p>
		<p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>HW_01 - Logical Function Allocations</b>
		</p>
		<p>Checks if a Logical Function is allocated on the expected Logical Component.</p>
		<p>
			<b>HW_02 - Physical Component Deployment</b>
		</p>
		<p>Checks if a Behavioral Physical Component is deployed in the expected Node Physical Component.</p>
		<p>
			<b>HW_03 - Logical Functional Exchange Allocations</b>
		</p>
		<p>Checks if a Logical Functional Exchange is allocated on the expected Component Exchange.</p>
		<p>
			<b>HW_04 - Physical Component Exchange Allocations</b>
		</p>
		<p>Checks if a Physical Component Exchange is allocated on the expected Physical Link.</p>
		<p>
			<br/>

			<br/>
		</p>
		<p>The validation rules can be enabled/disabled selectively by selecting Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Model Validation-&gt;Constraints. The multiphase transition rules can then be found under Capella-&gt;Subsystem Transition Addon:</p>

			<img height="299" width="604" border="0" src="Images/14.2.%20Usage%20instructions_html_m1fbca70a.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>To launch a validation, select a suitable model element (e.g. SystemEngineering) and choose &ldquo;Validate Model&rdquo; from its context menu.</p>
