The System to Sub System 				transition is not integrated by default in Capella. This 				extension is available for download on the Capella wiki.

== Transformation Command ==
 
Transitions are possible from one or several logical, physical components or one Configuration Item. The Multiphase Transition is only available from one or more selected node physical components.

 
# Open the source Capella project model
# Select one or several components (in the Project Explorer or in a 	diagram).
# From the contextual menu (right click), select 	&ldquo;System To SubSystem Transition&rdquo; and then, the kind of 	Transition to be performed.

== Configuration of the Transition ==
 
A configuration dialog opens and allows, among others, to choose the target model.

== Gap Analysis with Previous Iteration of the Transition ==
 
Once the target project selected, a dialog displaying the differences and the actions planned by the transition is displayed.

 
In the window, elements are sorted out by types

 
* The column &quot;Type&quot; indicates whether the 	difference concerns the presence of an element &ldquo;Element&rdquo; 	or the modification of a reference on an element &quot;Reference&quot;.
* The column &quot;Scope&quot; 	indicates whether the difference was found on the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; 	or &ldquo;Target&rdquo; model
* The column &quot;Differences&quot; 	indicates the title of the difference.
* The column &quot;Action&quot; indicates the type 	of action planned by the transition:
** &quot;Merge into target&quot;: application of 		the merge of the difference in the output model
** &quot;No predefined Action&quot;: the difference 		is not taken into account
*
* The column &quot;Detail&quot; 	gives the complete detail of the difference to investigative 	purposes very thin.

The effective application of the transition is performed by clicking on the button &quot;Apply Transition &quot;. The &quot;Save as CSV&quot; button allows to export the differences in a CSV file for a further analysis of the deviations.

 
It is possible to choose the type of elements that should be displayed in the difference window. To do so, choose Window / Preferences and then Capella / Transition Log Preferences.

== Transition Log ==
 
Once the transition performed, the Information view contains the listing of the actions performed. By right clicking on an action, the source and target object can be accessed:

== Validation Rules ==
 
The vertical transformation SA-LA-PA includes 4 validation rules that warn the user about inconsistent element allocations and deployments on target models. In general, these rules inspect the pre-allocation links generated by the multiphase transformation and crosscheck existing allocations and deployments against these pre-allocation links. A pre-allocation link is a kind of trace and thus filtered from the Capella Explorer by default. Each rule verifies a specific kind of allocation/deployment:

 
<br>
<br>

 
'''HW_01 - Logical Function Allocations'''

 
Checks if a Logical Function is allocated on the expected Logical Component.

 
'''HW_02 - Physical Component Deployment'''

 
Checks if a Behavioral Physical Component is deployed in the expected Node Physical Component.

 
'''HW_03 - Logical Functional Exchange Allocations'''

 
Checks if a Logical Functional Exchange is allocated on the expected Component Exchange.

 
'''HW_04 - Physical Component Exchange Allocations'''

 
Checks if a Physical Component Exchange is allocated on the expected Physical Link.

 
<br>
<br>

 
The validation rules can be enabled/disabled selectively by selecting Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Model Validation-&gt;Constraints. The multiphase transition rules can then be found under Capella-&gt;Subsystem Transition Addon:

To launch a validation, select a suitable model element (e.g. SystemEngineering) and choose &ldquo;Validate Model&rdquo; from its context menu.
