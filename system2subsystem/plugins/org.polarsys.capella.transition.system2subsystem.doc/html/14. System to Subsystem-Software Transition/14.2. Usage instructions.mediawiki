== TRANSFORMATION COMMAND ==
 
Transitions are possible from one or several logical, physical components or one Configuration Item. The Multiphase Transition is only available from one or more selected node physical components.

# Open the source Melody Advance project model
# Select one or several components (in the Project Explorer or in a diagram).
# From the contextual menu (right click), select “System To SubSystem Transition” and then, the kind of Transition to be performed.

== Configuration of the transition ==
 
A configuration dialog opens and allows, among others, to choose the target model.

== Gap analysis with previous iteration of the transition ==
 
Once the target project selected, a dialog displaying the differences and the actions planned by the transition is displayed.
 
In the window, elements are sorted out by types
 
* The column &quot;Type&quot; indicates whether the difference concerns the presence of an element &ldquo;Element&rdquo; or the modification of a reference on an element &quot;Reference&quot;.
* The column &quot;Scope&quot; indicates whether the difference was found on the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; or &ldquo;Target&rdquo; model
* The column &quot;Differences&quot; indicates the title of the difference.
* The column &quot;Action&quot; indicates the type of action planned by the transition:
** &quot;Merge into target&quot;: application of the merge of the difference in the output model
** &quot;No predefined Action&quot;: the difference is not taken into account
* The column &quot;Detail&quot; gives the complete detail of the difference to investigative purposes very thin.

The effective application of the transition is performed by clicking on the button &quot;Apply Transition &quot;. The &quot;Save has CSV&quot; button allows to export the differences in a CSV file for a further analysis of the deviations.
 
It is possible to choose the type of elements that should be displayed in the difference window. To do so, choose Window / Preferences and then Capella / Transition Log Preferences.

== Transition Log ==

Once the transition performed, the Information view contains the listing of the actions performed. By right clicking on an action, the source and target object can be accessed:

== Validation Rules ==

The vertical transformation SA-LA-PA includes 4 validation rules that warn the user about inconsistent element allocations and deployments on target models. In general, these rules inspect the pre-allocation links generated by the multiphase transformation and crosscheck existing allocations and deployments against these pre-allocation links. A pre-allocation link is a kind of trace and thus filtered from the Capella Explorer by default. Each rule verifies a specific kind of allocation/deployment:

'''HW_01 - Logical Function Allocations'''

Checks if a Logical Function is allocated on the expected Logical Component.

'''HW_02 - Physical Component Deployment'''

Checks if a Behavioral Physical Component is deployed in the expected Node Physical Component.

'''HW_03 - Logical Functional Exchange Allocations'''

Checks if a Logical Functional Exchange is allocated on the expected Component Exchange.

'''HW_04 - Physical Component Exchange Allocations'''

Checks if a Physical Component Exchange is allocated on the expected Physical Link.

The validation rules can be enabled/disabled selectively by selecting Window->Preferences->Model Validation->Constraints. The multiphase transition rules can then be found under Capella->Subsystem Transition Addon:

To launch a validation, select a suitable model element (e.g. SystemEngineering) and choose ''Validate Model'' from its context menu.
